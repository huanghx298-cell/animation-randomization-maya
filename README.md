# Non-Destructive Animation Randomization Tool (Maya)

This repository contains a Maya Python tool demonstrated in the linked video.

The tool duplicates a skeleton, applies controlled key randomization on a sample rig,
and writes the results back via animation layers without modifying the source animation.

This is a proof-of-concept tool focused on non-destructive animation workflows,
not a production-ready package.
